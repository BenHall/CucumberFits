# CucumberFits

## Description

CucumberFits is a web-based interface to edit, search through, and run [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) features written in [Gherkin](http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/gherkin), and stored in source-control.

It aims to make it intuitive and frictionless to read, run, and write features, as well as empower anyone involved in the software product to participate.

If this sounds a bit like FitNesse to you except with the intuitive and frictionless parts added, you're not far off from what we're aiming at. :-)
